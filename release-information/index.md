## Support Policy {#support-policy}

In January 2023, the term **general support** was replaced with **community
support** to avoid confusion with the VMware [terminology related to the
support lifecycle policy](https://tanzu.vmware.com/support/lifecycle_policy).

### Community Support

As a result of feedback from the [community](/contact#community-resources) and
those with a commercial license, RabbitMQ patch releases are produced
regularly. Community support is provided by [community
resources](/contact#community-resources). Refer to the previous table for end
dates for this support.

### Extended Commercial Support

Extended Commercial Support is included in [VMware’s Commercial Open Source
RabbitMQ Support](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss). RabbitMQ patches are
produced for security and high severity issues that are reported by users with
a commercial license. If you already have a license, go to [paid commercial
support enquiries](/contact#paid-support). Refer to the previous table for end
dates for this support.

## The Next Release

RabbitMQ 4.0 is next, it is expected to be released later in 2024.
