## Community Support Now Only Covers the 4.1.x Series

With the release of [RabbitMQ `4.1.0`](/blog/2025/04/15/rabbitmq-4.1.0-is-released), this series is
no longer covered by [community support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).

via the Broadcom customer portal.

All non-paying users must [upgrade to `4.1.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
in order to be covered by community support from the core team.


## Upgrade Guidance

If [upgrading](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade) from a version prior to 4.0, please consult
the [`4.0` release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.1).
